Description: The classic greeting, and a good example
 The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. It
 allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which
 would otherwise be unavailable to them. Seriously, though: this is
 an example of how to do a Debian package. It is the Debian version of
 the GNU Project's `hello world' program (which is itself an example
 for the GNU Project).
